This project demonstrates how to clean and prepare a messy sales dataset using Microsoft Excel. It is part of my learning journey as a data analyst, focusing on essential data cleaning techniques.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset simulates sales data for PlayStation consoles and includes common data quality issues such as:

- Missing values

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

## Skills Practiced
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing date formats

## Project Goals
- Transform raw, unstructured data into a clean and analyzable format
- Practice Excel functions like `TRIM`, `PROPER`, `IFERROR`, `TEXT`, and `VLOOKUP`
- Build a foundation for more advanced data analysis and visualization

## Next Steps
- Visualize cleaned data using charts and dashboards
- Replicate the project in Power BI or Python for comparison

## About Me
